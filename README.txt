This is documentation of my project.

First of all, this app is based on functionality, so look of the app may not be the best.

If you want to run it on your PC please take PLIK.BACPAC and import it into your database.
Open FinalApp.sln and go to DBcon.cs file, there you have to change data source into your's connection name.
If you will rename database name it into other name than "Capstone", please change also initial catalog to your name.
If you will do everything fine, app should start working without any problems.

In database we have got 3 accounts with password "pass1"
For Hospital Department - "jorge@mail.com"

For Insurance Department - "ins@mail.com"
