Welcome to my Capstone Project!

If you want to run it on your PC please take "Capstone.dacpac" file and import it into your database by clicking Import Data-tier Application.
Open FinalApp.sln and go to DBcon.cs file, there you have to change 'data source' into your's connection name.
If you will rename database name it into other name than "Capstone", please change also 'initial catalog' to your's database name.
If you will do everything fine, app should start working without any problems.

In database we have got 3 accounts with password "pass1"

For Insurance Department - "ins@mail.com"
